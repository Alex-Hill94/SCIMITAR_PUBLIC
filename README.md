## üß† Overview

**SCIMITAR** is a Python-based framework for designing and analysing **chest digital tomosynthesis (DT)** geometries. It models X-ray radiation coverage in multi-panel flat panel source (FPS) configurations by simulating intersections between distributed X-ray emitters and a detector plane.

It generates irradiation maps, computes quantitative metrics, and supports interactive 3D visualisation using **VTK** ‚Äî enabling rapid exploration of large design spaces to balance imaging performance, engineering feasibility, and clinical requirements.

---

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Flexible DT device design** ‚Äì Create single- or multi-panel configurations with custom emitter grids, cone angles, and panel orientations.  
- **Irradiation mapping** ‚Äì Compute pixel-wise irradiation distributions on arbitrary intersection planes.  
- **Quantitative metrics** ‚Äì Assess coverage, emitter overlap, gantry angle, and stray radiation.  
- **3D visualisation** ‚Äì View panels, cones, and patient models in an interactive VTK scene.

## üöÄ Installation & Example Run

Clone and navigate to the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/Alex-Hill94/SCIMITAR_PUBLIC.git
cd SCIMITAR_PUBLIC
```

Run the example workflow:

```
python Run.py
```

This builds a 4-panel system (each with a 4√ó4 emitter grid), computes and plots irradiation maps at detector and mid-height planes, visualises the geometry, and prints performance metrics.

## üìä Selected Output Metrics

| Metric | Description |
|---------|--------------|
| **Overlap_2D** | Uniformity of plane (e.g. detector surface) irradiation by all emitters |
| **Overlap_3D** | 3D extension of 2D overlap; evaluates volumetric coverage (requires `intersection_heights = full_intersection_heights`) |
| **Angular Range** | Maximum angular span between any pair of emitters |
| **Stray Radiation** | Number of detector pixels irradiated outside the detector bounds |

---

## üîÑ Typical Workflow

1. Modify input parameters in `Run.py` (e.g. cone angle, emitter count, panel tilt).  
2. Generate irradiation maps with `S.Irradiation()`.  
3. Evaluate metrics via `S.Metrics()`.  
4. Visualise geometry using `S.Visualise()`.  
5. Export results from the DataFrame `S.df`.
