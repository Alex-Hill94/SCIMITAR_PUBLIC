**SCIMITAR: Simulating Complete Irradiation Maps and Improving Tomosynthesis in X-ray Radiography**

This repository contains the publicly available version of the SCIMITAR software developed for the paper *SCIMITAR: Optimising chest digital tomosynthesis devices using geometric simulations and genetic algorithms* by A.D. Hill et al. 2025 (DOI 10.1088/2057-1976/ae0fa0).

## About

SCIMITAR is a Python-based simulation framework for designing and analysing chest digital tomosynthesis (DT) geometries. It models X-ray radiation coverage in multi-panel flat panel source (FPS) configurations via the intersections between distributed X-ray emitters and a detector plane. It computes irradiation maps, evaluates performance metrics, and supports 3D visualisation using VTK. The framework enables rapid exploration of large design spaces to identify configurations that balance imaging performance, engineering feasibility, and clinical requirements.

### üöß Repository Status

**This repository is currently under active development and is subject to change.**

### Key Features

- **Flexible DT Device Design** - Create single- or multi-panel configurations with customisable emitter grids, cone angles, panel orientations, and more.
- **Irradiation Mapping** - Compute pixel-wise irradiation distributions on user-defined intersection planes.
- **Quantitative Performance Metrics** - Quantify coverage, emitter overlap, angular range, and stray radiation extents.
- **3D Visualisation** - View panels, cones, and patient models in an interactive VTK viewer.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Installation and Example Use

Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/Alex-Hill94/SCIMITAR_PUBLIC.git
cd SCIMITAR_PUBLIC
```

The simplest way to run SCIMITAR is to execute the provided example:

```
python Run.py
```

This script builds a scene containing four panels, each containing a 4√ó4 grid of square-cone emitters. It generates 2D irradiation maps at detector and mid-height planes, visualises the geometry, and computes and prints performance metrics.

#### Select Output Metrics

- Overlap_2D ‚Äì Quantifies how uniformly a plane (e.g. the detector surface) is irradiated by all emitters.

- Overlap_3D ‚Äì Extends the 2D metric into three dimensions by evaluating how well the irradiated volume above the detector is covered. Note - for a meaningful value, set *intersection_heights = full_intersection_heights*.

- Angular range ‚Äì The maximum angular span between any pair of emitters in the configuration.

- Stray radiation ‚Äì The number of detector pixels receiving irradiation outside the defined detector bounds.

### Typical Workflow

- Modify geometry parameters in Run.py (e.g., number of emitters, cone angle, or panel tilt).

- Generate irradiation maps via S.Irradiation().

- Evaluate metrics using S.Metrics().

- Visualise geometry and intersections using S.Visualise().

- Export results from the DataFrame S.df.
