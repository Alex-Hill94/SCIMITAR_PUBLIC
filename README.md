## About

SCIMITAR is a geometry-based simulation framework designed to optimise chest digital tomosynthesis (DT) systems. The software models X-ray radiation coverage in multi-panel flat panel source (FPS) configurations and uses genetic algorithms to identify optimal device parameters.

### Key Features

- **Geometric simulation** of X-ray radiation coverage in chest DT systems
- **Performance evaluation** using irradiation uniformity metrics

### Applications

SCIMITAR was developed to design mobile chest DT devices for clinical applications including:
- Nasogastric tube placement verification
- Early lung cancer detection
- Low-dose 3D chest imaging

The framework enables rapid exploration of large design spaces to identify configurations that balance imaging performance, engineering feasibility, and clinical requirements.
